Attachments Validator for Mexican Invoices
==========================================

Since electronic invoices are legal documents, once they are stamped by the
SAT, they no longer should be deleted.

This module validates the deletion of attachments to ensure that, if they are
associated to an invoice, and that invoice is already stamped, they cannot be
deleted.
