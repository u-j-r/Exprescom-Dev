================================================

This module adds a new button on Asset that will allow to sell it according
to IFRS standards.

Considering that it have an asset of 1500 as initial value and that it has
already depreciated 750.

Odoo's module at Disposing or Selling of the asset fully depreciates the asset.

IFRS / IAS 16 - Derecognition - Paragraph 67 & 71.
--------------------------------------------------

-    67: The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property,
     plant and equipment shall be included in profit or loss when the item
     is derecognised (unless IFRS 16 Leases requires otherwise on a sale and
     leaseback). Gains shall not be classified as revenue.

-    71: The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property,
     plant and equipment shall be determined as the difference between the
     net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item.

To comply with the aforementioned, a journal entry is created as follows:
