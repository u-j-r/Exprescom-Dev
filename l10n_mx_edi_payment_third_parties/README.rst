Payment Complement with Third Parties
=====================================

This feature is designed to allow generate the payment complement with third
parties.

In which case I need this complement?

IÂ´m a builder, and I will build a house in a terrain that not is mine, the
owner is Terrain S.A.,

The house will be bought by a company that sells houses (INFONAVIT), then
for this case, MyCompany and Terrain S.A. have a contract, where each one
generates a CFDI to INFONAVIT. But INFONAVIT will pay me all the amount of
the house and after I will transfer that amount to Terrain S.A.

**How can I get this?**

In this case I, need to generate an invoice by the building total
($150,000.00) and validate it.

Then I need receive the CFDI generated by Terrain S.A. by the cost of the
terrain. ($50,000.00)

When I receive that document I attach it in the invoice.

Then I receive the payment from INFONAVIT by the total. I generate the
payment in Odoo by the total received. ($200,000.00)

In this case, the system generates a payment complement like this:
