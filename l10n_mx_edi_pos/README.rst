This module add a new button that allow generate the XML files related with
the session, after that it is closed.

The XML file take the data from all orders related with the session depending
in wich case is each order.

**What makes this module depending on the case?**

**CASE 1:**

With all orders that have not partner assigned, is generated one XML with the
generic partner, and is sent to sign with the PAC assigned in the session
journal.

The resultant XML is attached in the section.

**CASE 2:**

For this case, all the orders that have assigned the customer but are not
invoiced are splitted in two groups:

- Group 1
   All orders whose address partner have configured
    - Street
    - City
    - State
    - Country
    - Zip

- Group 2
  The rest of orders that have partner, but the addess is not completed.

All the orders in group 1 are sent to generate the invoice with the same
action that Odoo provide.

With all orders in group 2, is generated one XML for the generic partner, and
is sent to sign with the PAC assigned in the session journal.

The resultant XML is attached in the section.

**CASE 3:**

In this case like the orders already have an invoice, in the invoice is
generated directly the XML. In this module not are afected this orders.


Also is added the option to validate all invoices generated in the session
after to close it.
