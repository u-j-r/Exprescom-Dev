Other duties and taxes
=======================

Complement to include data that identify a local tax such as: taxes on accommodation
or lodging services, professional services, leases, among others.

Because these taxes are defined by state governments, although the concept is the
same, the rates can vary from one state to another.

Create local taxes in Taxes menu from Configuration in Accounting, assign them a
'Local' tag, and add them in invoice as usual.
