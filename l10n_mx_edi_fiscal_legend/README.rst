EDI Fiscal Legends Complement for the Mexican Localization
==========================================================

This module adds to the mexican localization the possibility of creating and
managing fiscal legends, so they may be included within electronic invoices.
These fiscal legends are intended to cover tax provisions, other than those
contained in the Mexican CFDI standard.

This module implements the Fiscal Legends complement, whose specifications
are given by the SAT. Such specifications may be consulted at 
`the SAT's reference page`_.
