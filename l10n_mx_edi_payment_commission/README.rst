Commissions support for EDI payments
====================================

Now the payment complement can support bank commissions

Example: 

* One invoice for 100 MXN

* One payment for 100 MXN minus bank commission

* The payment complement can be generated with 2 nodes:

  * Node 1: 93 MXN (Payment received)

  * Node 2: 3 MXN with payment method 17 (Bank commission).
