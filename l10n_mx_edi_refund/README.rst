EDI Refund
==========

This module adds the next features in the refund process:

* The invoice did not enter the corresponding month
* The client does not accept the invoice because any data related to 
  the method of payment, the origin or usage is incorrect.

In these cases, the credit note is created depending on the client, 
customizing its fields (method of payment, origin cfdi (01, 03, 04, 07) 
and use)
